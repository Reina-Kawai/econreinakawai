Welcome! 
======
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the [University of Washington](https://econ.washington.edu/). 

I am an applied macroeconomist with a [research portfolio](https://econmonicagr.github.io/research/) comprised of papers in international macroeconomics, macro-finance, and applied econometrics. And my passion is to develop theory-based policy implications through empirical work. My job market paper investigates the accuracy of IMF nowcasts in times of crises. This study provides guidance on how to further improve IMF nowcasts efficiency to better design and assess the loan programs and ultimately help countries restore economic growth. The second paper in my dissertation empirically examines the role of macroprudential policy in addressing the effects of external shocks on financial stability. Prior to pursuing Ph.D., I worked as a research analyst at the International Monetary Fund, primarily researching growth determinants in the emerging market economies. 

I am on the 2020â€“2021 job market and am available for interviews during and after the EEA and AEA/ASSA meetings.
