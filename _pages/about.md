Welcome! 
======
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Washington. 

My current research fields are international macroeconomics, macro-finance, and applied econometrics (time-series), with a particular interest in topics that have substantial policy implications for the public and or private sectors. Prior to pursuing Ph.D., I worked as a research analyst at the International Monetary Fund, primarily focused on researching emerging market issues. 

I am on the 2020â€“2021 job market and am available for interviews.
