[The Accuracy of IMF Crises Nowcasts](https://econmonicagr.github.io/files/MonicaGR_JMP.pdf) [[slides](https://econmonicagr.github.io/files/IMF Nowcasts_slides.pdf)]
(with Theo Eicher)
> The International Monetary Fund (IMF) provides loans to countries in economic crises as lender of last resort. Loan approval is tied to policy reforms and quantitative targets that are contingent on the IMF's crisis assessment. An extensive literature scrutinizes the efficacy of IMF loan programs, instead we examine the accuracy of the IMF's assessments of crisis conditions (nowcasts) that predicate program design. Analyzing an unprecedented 602 IMF loan programs from 1992 to 2019, we contradict the popular notion that IMF forecasts are generally optimistic. By disentangling the structure of the nowcast bias, we find the IMF systematically overestimates low-growth recoveries for Low-Income Countries' (LICs) GDPs while underestimating high-growth recoveries. Our unusually large sample allows us to document that Non-LICs nowcasts exhibit no statistically significant optimistic/pessimistic bias. We isolate the sources of inefficiencies in IMF nowcasts, including: (i) program objectives, (ii) program conditionality, (iii) geographic regions, (iv) global crises, and (v) geopolitics (elections, conflicts, disasters). In addition, we show that shorter nowcast horizons do not improve accuracy, and that GDP growth nowcasts improved substantially since 2013. Inflation nowcasts continue to struggle with efficiency as recently as 2018.

[Exchange Rates and Domestic Credit – Can Macroprudential Policy Reduce the Link?](https://econmonicagr.github.io/files/NOR_MaPP.pdf)
(with Erlend Walter Nier and Thorvardur Tjoervi Olafsson)
> This paper examines empirically the role of macroprudential policy in addressing the effects of external shocks on financial stability. In a sample of 62 economies over the period of 2000:Q1–2016:Q4, our dynamic panel regressions show that an appreciation of the local exchange rate is associated with a subsequent increase in the domestic credit gap, while a prior tightening of macroprudential policies dampens this effect. These results are strong for small open economies, and robust when we explicitly account for potential simultaneity and reverse causality biases. We also examine a feedback effect where strong domestic credit pulls in additional cross-border funding, potentially further increasing systemic risk, and find that targeted capital controls can play a complementary role in alleviating this effect.
