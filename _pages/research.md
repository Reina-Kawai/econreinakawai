[The Accuracy of IMF Crises Nowcasts](https://econmonicagr.github.io/files/MonicaGR_JMP_abstract.pdf)  
(with Theo Eicher)
> As lender of last resort, the IMF provides loans to countries in economic crises. Loan disbursements require mandated policy reforms and qualitative performance criteria whose breadths and stringencies are contingent on IMF crisis assessments. A rich literature scrutinizes the efficacy of IMF crisis loan programs, our study examines the accuracy of the underlying IMF nowcasts that predicated program design. Analyzing 600 IMF crisis loan programs from 1992 to 2019, we find IMF forecast assessments of the crisis conditions differ substantially from the realized data. We also test if forecasts efficiently integrated all information available to the IMF at the time of the forecasts including (i) program objectives, (ii) program conditionality, (iii) country types, and (iv) crisis types. An important finding is that IMF GDP growth forecasts during crises as improved substantially since 2006.

[Exchange Rates and Domestic Credit – Can Macroprudential Policy Reduce the Link?](https://econmonicagr.github.io/files/NOR_MaPP.pdf)
(with Erlend Walter Nier and Thorvardur Tjoervi Olafsson)
> This paper examines empirically the role of macroprudential policy in addressing the effects of external shocks on financial stability. In a sample of 62 economies over the period of 2000:Q1–2016:Q4, our dynamic panel regressions show that an appreciation of the local exchange rate is associated with a subsequent increase in the domestic credit gap, while a prior tightening of macroprudential policies dampens this effect. These results are strong for small open economies, and robust when we explicitly account for potential simultaneity and reverse causality biases. We also examine a feedback effect where strong domestic credit pulls in additional cross-border funding, potentially further increasing systemic risk, and find that targeted capital controls can play a complementary role in alleviating this effect.
